##  Repository Overview

**This repository is developed by Muhammad Javed for learning and practice purposes.**

This repository focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts, specifically **model evaluation metrics** and **topic modeling techniques**, which are essential for analyzing and understanding text-based machine learning models.

The notebooks provide **conceptual understanding, mathematical intuition, and hands-on implementation** using Python and Scikit-learn.

This repository is intended as **study material and portfolio demonstration**, not a production-ready project.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to evaluate NLP classification models
- Learn commonly used evaluation metrics
- Understand topic modeling concepts
- Implement probabilistic and matrix-based topic modeling techniques
- Interpret topic modeling results

---

##  NLP Evaluation Metrics Covered

### Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision** – Correct positive predictions
- **Recall** – Ability to identify actual positives
- **F1-Score** – Balance between precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix** – Detailed prediction breakdown

---

##  Topic Modeling Techniques Covered

### 🔹 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Probabilistic topic modeling approach
- Represents documents as topic distributions

### 🔹 Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Matrix factorization-based topic modeling
- Works well with TF-IDF features

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
